/**
 * An interface to SAAMS:
 * A Ground Operations Controller Screen:
 * Inputs events from GOC (a person), and displays aircraft and gate information.
 * This class is a controller for the GateInfoDatabase and the AircraftManagementDatabase: sending them messages to change the gate or aircraft status information.
 * This class also registers as an observer of the GateInfoDatabase and the AircraftManagementDatabase, and is notified whenever any change occurs in those <<model>> elements.
 * See written documentation.
