/**
 * Contains all details of a flight: the flight code, itinerary and passenger list.
 * This is the package of information downloaded from an aircraft by the RadarTransceiver as the aircraft enters Stirling Airport's airspace.
 * Not obvious from the class diagram is that the RadarTransceiver boundary class should construct a FlightDescriptor when it "detects" an aircraft, and passes that object to the AircraftManagementDatabase as the parameter of a radarDetect message. (Since this will probably/possibly be local to an event handler method in RadarTransceiver, there is no attribute association from RadarTransceiver to FlightDescriptor.)
